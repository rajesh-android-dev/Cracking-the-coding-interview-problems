 * Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the

 * DEFINITION
 * Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so
 * as to make a loop in the linked list.
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: A -) B -) C -) 0 -) E - ) C[thesameCasearlierl
 * Output: C
